        <h1>Celebrating 30: A Decade of Growth and New Beginnings</h1>
        <p>As I complete 30 years in July 2025, it feels surreal to reflect on the journey that began in 2016. Back then, I was a fresh engineering graduate, eager to start my professional life. But life had bigger plans for me—plans that led me through an exciting decade of transformation, both personally and professionally.</p>

        <h2>Laying the Foundation: Education and Transition</h2>
        <p>The year 2016 marked a pivotal moment in my life. Shortly after completing my BE, I started working while simultaneously preparing for the TANCET MBA exam. I’d initially planned to pursue an MBA part-time, but a good TANCET result and the unwavering support of my parents encouraged me to take the leap into a full-time program. I chose the Department of Management Studies (DOMS) at the University of Madras, which offered the perfect blend of quality education and affordability.</p>
        <p>Those two years in Chennai were truly transformative. The vibrant campus life and the chance to interact with students from over 80 departments enriched my perspective. My university hostel roommate, a junior lawyer pursuing his ML, gave me invaluable insights into professional life that still guide me today. The diverse experiences and conversations with peers and seniors provided me with a foundation that extended far beyond the classroom.</p>

        <h2>Stepping into the Professional World</h2>
        <p>Chennai wasn’t just about academics; it also gave me my professional start. Networking with like-minded people opened doors I hadn’t imagined. By the time I completed my MBA, I had three internships in digital marketing under my belt. My interest in social media and building communities naturally led me to this field.</p>
        <p>After a year working in Chennai, I moved to Bangalore to explore new opportunities. This was when I transitioned into content operations, a move fueled by my love for Tamil content. This shift introduced me to the intricacies of product development, sowing the seeds for what would become my true calling: product management.</p>

        <h2>Finding My Calling: Product Management</h2>
        <p>During my time in content operations, I worked closely with product teams on projects that deeply resonated with me, including introducing an audio chat feature. These experiences solidified my decision to pursue a career in product management. Over time, I transitioned into an Associate Product Manager (APM) role and, later, a Product Manager.</p>
        <p>As I complete two years as a Product Manager, I’ve come to appreciate the collaborative nature of this role. Working with engineers, designers, sales, and marketing teams has taught me the importance of empathy and clear communication. The most rewarding part, however, is building solutions that address real customer needs. Every challenge and interaction has been a step forward in my growth.</p>

        <h2>Personal Milestones and Growth</h2>
        <p>While my professional journey evolved, so did my personal life. Marriage brought a profound change in me. My wife’s calm demeanor and support helped me manage my temper and approach life with greater patience. This change reflected positively in my interactions with stakeholders at work.</p>
        <p>Last year, my wife and I welcomed our daughter, a milestone that has been nothing short of magical. Fatherhood has reshaped my priorities, teaching me to focus on what truly matters. Every day, her smile—whether in person or through a video call—has a way of grounding me, reminding me of life’s simple joys.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>The past decade has been a journey of exploration, growth, and learning. From a young graduate in 2016 to a Product Manager and father in 2025, every experience has shaped the person I am today. As I look to the future, I’m excited about the opportunities to continue growing professionally, nurturing my family, and making meaningful contributions to the world around me.</p>
        <p>Turning 30 feels less like a milestone and more like a celebration of everything the past decade has brought my way. Here’s to the next chapter—one filled with even more learning, love, and adventure!</p>
